# Welcome to Celenium

Welcome to Celenium, the premier blockchain explorer dedicated to the [Celestia](https://celestia.org) Network. This platform serves as an essential tool for developers, providing a comprehensive suite of functionalities designed to enhance your experience with the Celestia blockchain. Our mission is to deliver an intuitive and robust explorer that not only meets but exceeds the needs of our community.

The architecture of Celenium has the following components:

-   An indexer that communicates with consensus and data availability layer nodes, fetches blob information and stores it in a PostgreSQL database
-   A frontend that allows navigating the data, having specific pages for blocks, namespaces, transactions, addresses, and blobs.
-   A rollup leaderboard with ability to view registered rollups activity and validate its operations.

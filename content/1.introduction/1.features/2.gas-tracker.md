# Feature: Gas Tracker

In the Celestia ecosystem, the mechanics of gas and transaction fees are integral to its modular blockchain design, focusing on data availability and efficient transaction processing. The fee market, a key feature, employs an auction mechanism that allows users to bid for their transactions to be included in the next block. This is especially critical when network demand is high, ensuring that transactions are processed efficiently and without undue delay.

Transactions specifically aimed at data storage, termed `PayForBlobs`, are a central aspect of Celestia's operations. These transactions enable developers to publish data on the network, with the fees for these operations denominated in Celestia's native asset, TIA. The calculation of these fees takes into account various factors, including:

- A fixed cost, which is a static value (65,000 gas),
- The SparseSharesNeeded for each blob, which indicates the number of shares needed for each blob in the transaction,
- The Share Size, which is the size of each share, and
- The Gas Cost Per Blob Byte, a parameter that could be adjusted through governance mechanisms.

For estimating gas, users can use the `DefaultEstimateGas` function, which estimates the gas based on a linear model dependent on governance parameters such as `gasPerByte` and `txSizeCost`. This estimation assumes that the `MsgPayForBlobs` is the only message in the transaction.

When a user submits any other transaction, they set the gas fee, which is often specified directly by users. The total cost for the transaction is then calculated as the product of the estimated gas limit and the gas price. Users must accurately estimate the gas limit to avoid overpaying, as unused gas is not refunded by the state machine.

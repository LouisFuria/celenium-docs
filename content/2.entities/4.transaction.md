Celestia is a novel blockchain platform that employs a unique approach to scalability and data availability, heavily leveraging the Cosmos SDK to structure its transaction system. Transactions are entities created by end-users to initiate changes within the application's state.

## The Lifecycle of a Transaction

The process begins when users create transactions to trigger specific state changes, such as transferring tokens or submitting data. Each transaction comprises one or more sdk.Msgs that need to be signed by the user's private key before being broadcast to the network. Upon successful validation and inclusion in a block, these transactions contribute to the network's consensus and the ongoing evolution of the blockchain's state.

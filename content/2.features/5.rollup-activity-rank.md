# Introducing the Rollup Activity Rank: A New North Star for the Celestia Ecosystem


The Celestia ecosystem is expanding at an incredible pace, with new and innovative rollups launching almost every week. This explosion of creativity is exciting, but it also brings a challenge: How do you tell which projects are gaining real traction? How can users, developers, and investors identify the rollups with genuine momentum?

Today, we're thrilled to answer that question. We are introducing the updated **Rollup Activity Rank**, a dynamic ranking system designed to bring clarity and transparency to the ecosystem.

The Rollup Activity Rank solves a critical problem: it moves beyond simple, one-dimensional metrics. It’s not just about how much money a project has, but about its momentum, its on-chain footprint, its efficiency, and its development pulse. It’s a holistic score designed to measure the true health and activity of a rollup.


## How Can You Use This Ranking?

The Rollup Activity Rank is a powerful tool for everyone in the Celestia community.

* **For Users:** Discover the most active and promising rollups to use and explore. Gauge the health of projects you’re already invested in, ensuring they are growing and active.
* **For Investors & Analysts:** Use it as a data-driven starting point to identify trends and promising investment opportunities. Track the momentum of the entire ecosystem at a glance.
* **For Developers:** Benchmark your project’s performance against the competition. Understand your strengths and weaknesses and gain clear insights into how you can improve.


## The Secret Sauce: How the Rank is Calculated

Our goal was to create a score that is fair, transparent, and difficult to manipulate. The final rank is a weighted average of **six key metrics**, updated every hour to provide a near-real-time view of the ecosystem.

Let's break down the six metrics we measure.


### 1. On-chain Footprint: Blobs (20% Weight)

On Celestia, data is published in "blobs." Think of these as data packets that prove a rollup is active and processing transactions. We measure the number of blobs a rollup publishes. To reward consistent activity, this score is logarithmic, meaning it's easier to score points when you're starting out, but it takes significant activity to rank among the top.
* **Why it matters:** It’s a direct measure of on-chain activity and user engagement.


### 2. Cost-Effectiveness: Price for Megabyte (20% Weight)

This metric is simple: how much does it cost to post data to Celestia via the rollup? In this case, a lower price is better. This rewards rollups that are efficient and provide good value for their users.
* **Why it matters:** It measures the economic efficiency and competitiveness of a rollup.


### 3. Liveness: Last Activity (20% Weight)

How recently did the rollup post data? This metric acts as a "heartbeat monitor." A project that is consistently active will score high, while a project that goes silent will see its score decay over time.
* **Why it matters:** It ensures the ranking reflects current, active projects, not abandoned ones.


### 4. Growth & Stability: Total Value Locked (TVL) (30% Weight)

To measure this metric we reward **the momentum and stability of TVL growth** over the past month (up to 31 days). We calculate the **total growth** during this period and then divide it by a **volatility penalty**. This formula rewards rollups with high, *stable* growth while penalizing those with chaotic, pump-and-dump style spikes.
* **Example:** A project that grows its TVL steadily from \$2M to \$4M is scored more highly than a project that spikes from \$5M to \$10M overnight, only to crash back down to \$5M. We reward quality, sustainable growth, not volatile hype.
* **Why it matters:** It measures a project's ability to attract and, more importantly, *retain* capital and user confidence.


#### 5. Development Pulse: Weekly Commits (5% Weight)

Is the project's code being actively worked on? We measure the number of code updates in the past week. It’s a clear indicator that a team is actively building and improving their product.
* **Why it matters:** This is a powerful indicator of a team's engagement and long-term commitment to their project.


#### 6. Development Freshness: Last Commit (5% Weight)

How recently did the team push code? Here we measure how recently the team has pushed an update to their public code repositories.
* **Why it matters:** This metric rewards projects with an active and ongoing development cycle.

## How to Improve Your Rank: A Guide for Rollup Developers

The ranking formula is transparent, which means the path to improving your score is clear. Here are a few examples of how you can climb the ranks.

1. **Drive Real Usage:** The `Blobs` score is a direct reflection of your on-chain activity. Launch campaigns, build compelling dApps, and do whatever it takes to encourage users to transact on your rollup. The more data you post to Celestia, the higher your score.

2. **Optimize for Efficiency:** Work on the technical side of your rollup to lower the `Price for Mb`. Passing those savings on to your users not only makes your project more attractive but also directly improves your rank.

3. **Focus on Sustainable Growth:** When it comes to TVL, think marathon, not sprint. Attract users and capital that believe in your long-term vision. Our algorithm is specifically designed to reward stable, consistent growth over short-term, volatile spikes.

4. **Ship Consistently:** Maintain a steady drumbeat of development. A healthy, active GitHub repository with frequent commits shows the world (and our ranking system) that you are building for the future.


## A More Transparent Future

The Rollup Activity Rank is more than just a leaderboard; it's a commitment to a more transparent and meritocratic Celestia ecosystem. We believe that by providing clear, data-driven insights, we can empower users, reward builders, and accelerate the growth of the entire modular world.
